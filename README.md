# Belly_Button_Biodiversity_interactive_web_visualizations

In this project, an interactive dashboard was built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
